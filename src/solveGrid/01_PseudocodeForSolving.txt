Steps for solving a sudoku grid:

1. while the grid is not full and no changes have been made 
(changes are: adding a number or reducing a possible value)
    2. apply the sudoku rules to reduces possible Values for every free Cell in the grid
    3. apply naked Singles to identify cells which have only one possible value left
        4. If (in 3) a cell has been found insert the value and go back to 2
        5. If (in 3) no cell has been apply hidden Single algorithm
            6. If (in 5) a cell has been found insert the value and go back to 2
            7. If (in 5) no cell has been found apply ....
                etc. :  other algorithms in the same fashion as in 3/5 (and go back to step 2 afterwards)
 
other algorithms are: hidden pairs, hidden triples, pointing pairs, pointing triples, X-Wing, Y-Wing, XY-Wing, Bruteforce
IMPORTANT: every time a value gets added the sudoku rules need to be checked again to keep the possible values up to date

'sudoku rules' 
    --> every number eliminates the possible value of each free cell it 'can see'
    or: Every Row, Column and Box in the grid needs to contain the numbers from one to nine.
'naked single' 
    --> a cell which has one one possible value left
    algorithm complexity: low
    implementation: easy
    "findable for human": medium

'hidden single' 
    --> a possible value of a cell which is the only one of its kind in the entire row/column/box
    algorithm complexity: medium
    implementation: medium
    "findable for human": very easy

'easy Grids' --> can be solved with just naked Singles and hidden Singles!
'medium Grids' --> not yet solvable (with only just hidden-and naked single)
'hard Grids' --> not yet solvable (with only just hidden-and naked single)
'hidden pair' -->
