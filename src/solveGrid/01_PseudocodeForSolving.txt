Steps for solving a grid I am using:

1. Find 'hidden singles', insert them into the grid (the easy grids can be solved with this tequnique only!)
2. while there are still empty cells: 
    2.1 Apply 'sudoku rules', 'poitin pairs', 'hidden pairs' and other tequniques to reduces the 
        possible Values for each cell.
    2.2 Apply 'naked Single' to check if any empty cell has only one possible value left


'hidden single' --> 
'sudoku rules' -->
'naked single' -->
